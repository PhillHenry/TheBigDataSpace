### The Big Data Space
An architect's most important skill should not be PowerPoint.

What an architect brings to the party is a nexus of skills. These skills inform their ability to shape solutions that require little or no change. And if change is required, it should be painless.

This site is dedicated to common, big data solutions. It shows how they are used by example, not hand-waving arguments that are too abstract to be useful.

Like architecture in the physical world, logical architecture should be delightful by barely being noticed.
